This GO app is used in tandem with my website in order to send an email when a user submits information in a form on the website.

This is specifically for submitting for further contact on a website.

You can see the organization of the field by looking at the code.

You can look at my roberson-ins.com repository for how the application hooks into the HTML and HTMX.
